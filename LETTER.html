				<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
				<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
			<letter>
				<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the universityof Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
				of your PhD next year. <strong>I</strong>  will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
				<h3>starting dates</h3><br>
				<p>we are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>could start at 					the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>First semester: 9 september 2016</li>
					<li>Second semester: 15 january 2017</li>
					<li>Thrid semester: 2 May 2017</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date would you prefer.<br><br>you can find more information about 
				<a href="https://x.com/seltileng?t=hdrgodYMt8B4-1r1NsGw6w&s=09" targwet="_blank">importeant university dates</a> on our website.</p>
				<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
				<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, wee have a pretty open-mindedd research facility -- as long as the subjects fall<br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigged<br>by aree as follows, in order of priority:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resvatrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
					<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the<br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3&times;10<sup>3</sup>) increasing to 3&times;10<sup>4</sup>)<br>
					<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.<br>
				</ol>
				So please can you provide more iformation on each of these subjects, including how long youo'd expect the<br>research to tacke, required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know? thanks.<br>
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<h3>Exotic dance moves </h3>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>
Polynesian chicken dance
<dd>
 	A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dace around </dd><dd>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be “fruitful”.</dd>
Icelandic brownian shuffle







	<dd>Before the icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to practice this dace, which <br>involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>modern styles such as twerking.</dd>
Arctic robot dance.






	<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>discovered a new dace style characterised by”robotic”, stilled movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>because they were really cold.</dd><br>

For more of my research, <a href="https://x.com/seltileng?t=hdrgodYMt8B4-1r1NsGw6w&s=09" targwet="_blank">see my exotic dance research page.<a><br><br>
Yours sincerely,<br><br>
Dr Eleanor Gaye <br><br>
